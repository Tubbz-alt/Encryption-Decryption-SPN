# Encryption-Decryption-SPN.

## Dependencies:
python3, sympy 1.4.

## Instructions:
Download all files and run SPN.py. Run it in terminal for best results.

## Additional important notes:
This program is rather dirty because of the hurry in which I had to write it. I wrote this for an assignment which is/was to be submitted 1 day after the upload date. I might need to beautify it eventually.

## Warning: 
Do NOT to use any non standard cryptographic algorithm for anything serious. 99% of the algorithms out there are unsafe to use.
