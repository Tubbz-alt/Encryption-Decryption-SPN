# Encryption-Decryption-SPN.

Dependencies: python3, sympy 1.4.
Instructions: Download all files and run SPN.py. Run it in terminal for best results.

Additional important notes:
This program is rather dirty because of the hurry in which I had to write it. I wrote this for an assignment which is/was to be submitted 1 day after the upload date. I might need to beautify it before submitting, but before that I need to do the documentation, which takes more priority.

ps. It's really really easy to break this algorithm, so try not to use it for anything serious.
